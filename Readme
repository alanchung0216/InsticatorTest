this project will do the followings
    
    1. create test employee data set in JSON format to "test.json"       
    2. read the test data set via JSON reader from "test.json"
    3. use Spring framwork to inject employee and subclasses objects
        and fill up object data based on employee types 
        (employee,fulltime, partime, intern, contractor)
    4. set up Hibernate connection to postgres data base
        and map objects to one employee table which consists
        of employee and subclasses data
    5. do CRUD operations (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)
    6. finally write existing employess with JSON format to "employees.json".
